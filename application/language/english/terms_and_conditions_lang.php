<li>  Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located; if so, you are not authorized to use your payment card to complete your deposit.</li>
<li>  Funds deposited in the Account shall be available for use within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of money (or earlier where possible). The twenty-four (24) hour time frame specifically excludes the time that the financial institution, or other payment provider, take to process the transfer.</li>
<li>  We reserve the right to set a minimum and maximum amount of funds that can be deposited per transaction. Such amounts may be varied at our discretion.</li>
<li>  You may only use your own personal credit/debit card or other payment method to fund your Account. The name appearing on the credit cards, or registered on the payment accounts used for deposits or pay-outs must correspond to the name registered on your Account.</li>
<li>  You may choose to process your deposit in an alternative currency, as offered by the Company at the time. you can transfer funds from crypto-wallets and credit cards under your control. The minimum deposit amount is 1 mBTC (0.001 BTC). The minimum deposit amount in Ethereum is 0.01 ETH. The minimum Euro/USD/GBP deposit amount is 10. All smaller deposits will be void.</li>
<p><i>Note: Most deposits are processed at lightning speed, however, there may be some delays from 3rd party services (for example e-wallets, exchanges) that may debit your private account but not add the transaction to the blockchain for several hours. After the transaction is added to the blockchain it needs to get a certain number of confirmations. The number of confirmations we need depends on the cryptocurrency you used for depositing (For example it is 3 for BTC). The transaction confirmation time depends on the paid transaction fee because cryptocurrency miners are first verifying transactions with higher fees. A transaction with a really small fee can, therefore, take hours or more to confirm. Therefore, when making a deposit make sure that your transaction is using at least the average recommended fee during that time. In that case, it usually takes up to 10 minutes for a transaction to get at least 1 confirmation.</i> </p>
<p><i> Note: that your bank or payment service provider may charge you additional fees for deposits, withdrawals of currency conversion according to their terms and conditions and your user agreement.</i> </p>
</li>  We reserve the right to request proof of payments to the Account at any moment.</li> </ol></li>

Withdrawal requests will be limited to a minimum of €100 per withdrawal request. Any request lower than this amount will be declined, and the funds will be returned to the player's balance. A player may then place a new withdrawal request in line with this limit.
<li> Withdrawal requests will be limited to a maximum of €5,000 per thirty (30) day period. Any requests exceeding these amounts will be declined, and the funds will be returned to your Account balance. You may then place a new withdrawal request in-line with this limit.</li>
<li> If a player's accumulated deposit amount does not exceed €200, player will be entitled only up to 10X last deposit. This maximum pay-out will be enforced also in cases where the player made additional deposits which were deemed at the sole discretion of the Casino to have been made in order to exceed the €200 accumulated deposit amount.</li>
<li> Should you place deposit limits on your account, any withdrawal request will be limited to five (5) times the deposit limit, and not exceed €5,000 per thirty (30) day period. Any requests exceeding this amount will be declined, and the funds will be returned to your Account balance. You may then place a new withdrawal request in-line with this limit.</li>

In some cases, at the discretion of the Company, the additional amount may be paid to the player through one of the deposit methods already used on the Account.</li>
<li> In the cases where deposits were processed through crypto currency, Withdrawals will be processed to the wallet address which was used during the deposit. The minimum withdrawal amount is as following:<br>
<div class='container my-2'>
Bitcoins Ƀ 0.002 = mɃ 2 = µɃ 2000.<br>
Ethereum 0.02 ETH<br></div>
After we have processed a withdrawal, the transaction must be confirmed on the blockchain. Depending on the amount of the withdrawal, the transaction must receive a certain number of confirmations. One confirmation usually takes up to 20 minutes.</li>
